  AFFECTS: Users with existing installs before commit 7a896c5
  AUTHOR: milki

  As of commit 7a896c5, the tag 'plans' was renamed to 'pushplans' in order
  to clarify the confusion between testplans and pushplans.

  In order to upgrade from an existing pushmanager setup, existing push
  requests and push checklists in the database with the tag 'plans' should be
  changed to use 'pushplans' instead.

  Two convenience scripts, tools/rename_tag.py and
  tools/rename_checklist_type.py have been included to facilitate these
  changes. Additionally, pushplans/rename_push_to_pushplans.sh has been
  provided for this particular change.

  To run:
    sh pushplans/rename_push_to_pushplan.sh

  from the production pushmanager root such that the production config.yaml is
  present and readable
